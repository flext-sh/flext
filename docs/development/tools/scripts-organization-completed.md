# Script Organization Completed

All GitHub workflow files have been updated and organized. This include:

1. Modern CI/CD configuration
2. Security scanning workflows
3. Documentation automation
4. Release management
5. Issue management and labeling

The setup includes:

- Python version testing across 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- Security scanning with Bandit, CodeQL, and OSV
- Automated dependency management with Dependabot
- Documentation building and deployment
- Release automation (without PyPI publishing for now)

The workflows are organized into clear, separate files with concise documentation.

## Overview

The `scripts` directory has been successfully reorganized as described in `README_SCRIPTS_REORGANIZATION.md`.
All original functionality has been preserved, while adding new features for script documentation and easier access to utility scripts.

## Improvements Made

1. **Executed Setup Scripts**:

   - `setup_scripts.sh` has been executed to create symlinks for the main management scripts
   - Added to PATH through .bashrc for easy access

2. **Added Documentation Tools**:

   - Created `document_scripts.py` - A new tool to automatically document Python scripts
   - Generated `SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md` - A comprehensive summary of all scripts in the workspace
   - Added docstrings to scripts that were missing them

3. **Created Utility Wrappers**:

   - Added `create_utility_wrappers.sh` - Creates bin wrappers for utility scripts
   - Created bin wrappers for all utility scripts (flext_long_lines.py, update_packages.py, etc.)
   - All scripts accessible through simple commands (fix-longlines, update-packages, etc.)

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Updated `scripts/README.md` to include utility scripts and wrappers
   - Improved directory structure documentation

## Available Commands

After sourcing `~/.bashrc`, you can use the following commands from anywhere in the workspace:

### Core Commands

- `flext_project-manage` - Manage projects
- `scaffold-manage` - Manage scaffolds
- `git-manage` - Git operations
- `setup` - Setup the workspace
- `status` - Show flext_project status
- `scaffold` - Manage scaffolds (shorthand)
- `git-op` - Git operations (shorthand)

### Utility Commands

- `fix-longlines` - Fix long lines in Python files
- `update-packages` - Update packages in the virtualenv
- `update-lint-excludes` - Update lint excludes in pyproject.toml
- `pep8-check` - Check PEP 8 compliance
- `pep8-apply` - Apply PEP 8 standards
- `document-scripts` - Document Python scripts

## Getting Started

1. If you haven't already, source your bashrc to add the bin directory to your PATH:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Try some of the commands:

   ```bash
   # Show flext_project status
   status

   # Document Python scripts
   document-scripts --check

   # Show git status
   git-op status
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Consider running `document-scripts --update` to add or improve docstrings in any script that needs them
2. Use `fix-longlines` to fix long lines in Python files that exceed the PEP 8 limit (88 characters)
3. Keep the scripts organized by following the pattern established in the workspace
